# Astar-Pathfinder
The program is used to display a visualization to how the A* pathfinding algorithm works. The python source file uses pygame and is required prior to running it in command line. After installing pygame, a 50x50 grid display will show up. The user can click on two grid nodes to place the start and end nodes. Additionally, after the two nodes are placed you may also place barriers that will act as a wall which prevents the A* algorithm from going past it and forces it to find a way around. Once the barriers have been placed, you may press space to begin the visualization. After the visualization has ended, you may press 'c' to clear the grid and start over again. At any time during the launch of the program, you can click the 'X' on the top of the window to close the program.
